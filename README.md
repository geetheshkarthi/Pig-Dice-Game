# 🎲 Pig Dice Game using Jack and VM

Welcome to the Pig Dice Game — a classic turn-based dice game, developed entirely in the **Jack programming language** and executed on a **Virtual Machine (VM)** as part of the *Elements of Computing-II* coursework at Amrita School of Artificial Intelligence.

This project combines **game development principles**, **modular programming**, and **virtual machine execution concepts**, making it an exciting learning resource for programming enthusiasts.

## 🎯 About the Game

The Pig Dice Game is a simple two-player dice game where players take turns to roll a die and accumulate points. The goal is to be the first to reach a **target score of 20**.  
Players must decide whether to roll again (risking losing their points) or hold and secure their current score.

Implemented in Jack, the game demonstrates:
- Dice rolling and random number generation
- Turn-based gameplay management
- Scorekeeping and decision-making logic
- A simple text-based user interface

---

## ✨ Features
- Turn-based gameplay between two players
- Realistic dice rolling with custom random number generation
- Banking scores or risking a roll
- Modular code design: Main, Player, and Random classes
- Lightweight and easy to run on any Nand2Tetris VM Emulator
